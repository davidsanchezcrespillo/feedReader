Just a test feed reader using Angular.js. I took the following as starting point: http://www.ivivelabs.com/blog/making-a-quick-feed-reader-using-angularjs/

The data for the feeds can be configured in the data.js file. Three variables are available:
- allSources
- allTags
- appTitle

Live demo, with useful feeds for learners of the Lithuanian language: http://sanchezcrespillo.info/david/ltFeeds
